Read the Docs Builder
=====================

This module is the main building interface to Read the Docs.
It has no explicit dependency on RTD code itself,
and can be used outside of RTD to test your builds.

.. warning:: This code is still under active development and isn't considered stable.
             Please report bugs you find and contribute back if you are so inclined.

Install
-------

Install with pip::

    pip install readthedocs-build

CLI Use
-------

Running a build is simple::

	rtd-build 

This will search for a ``readthedocs.yml`` file or a ``conf.py`` file,
and build your documentation.
It will use your local Python environment.

Using a specific ``readthedocs.yml`` file::

	rtd-build --config=foo/rtd.yml

You can set a specific output directory::

	rtd-build --output=html_dir

Run a fully isolated build, the most similar to our Read the Docs hosting environment::

	rtd-build --full --output=html_dir

Library Use
-----------


An example use of this library is:

.. code-block:: python

	import os

	from readthedocs_build.doc_builder.loader import loading
	from readthedocs_build.doc_builder.state import BuildState

	docs_dir = os.getcwd()

	state = BuildState(root=docs_dir)
	BuilderClass = loading.get('sphinx')
	builder = BuilderClass(state=state)
	builder.build()

This will run the same code as RTD,
so you should be able to debug the build more easily.

Development
-----------

Just run::

    pip install -e .

This will install the project into your environment, and have it pick up changes as you edit them in the code.

To run the tests::

    ./runtests.sh

Build Process
-------------

Read the Docs creates a full environment for your build.
In your local environment,
you can choose what portions of this environment to re-create.
You can either use your existing environment with our builder code installed,
or allow our builder to create a fully isolated environment for itself.
A fully isolated environment is much closer to our production build environment for testing purposes.
